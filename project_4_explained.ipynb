    "# Movie Recommender System Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This document explains the Movie Recommender System, an application that recommends movies based on user preferences. The system utilizes `numpy` and `pandas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTML File Overview\n",
    "The HTML file contains two key components for recommending movies: System I (based on genres) and System II (based on Item-Based Collaborative Filtering, IBCF).\n",
    "\n",
    "### System I: Recommendation Based on Genres\n",
    "This system recommends movies based on a user's favorite movie genre. The recommendation scheme involves defining \"most popular\" or \"highly-rated\" within a genre. For instance:\n",
    "- **Top Five Most Popular Movies**: Defined as those with the highest number of ratings in a genre.\n",
    "- **Top Five Highly-Rated Movies**: Defined as those with the highest average rating, ensuring a minimum number of ratings to qualify.\n",
    "\n",
    "### System II: Recommendation Based on IBCF\n",
    "This system follows these steps:\n",
    "1. **Normalize the Rating Matrix (R)**: Center each row by subtracting row means from each row, computed based on non-NA entries.\n",
    "2. **Compute Cosine Similarity**: Calculate similarity among movies, considering users who rated both movies. Ignore similarities based on less than three user ratings.\n",
    "3. **Create the Similarity Matrix (S)**: Transform the cosine similarity to ensure measures are between 0 and 1. Set similarities based on fewer than three ratings to NA. Sort and keep the top 30 non-NA similarity measures per row, setting the rest to NA.\n",
    "4. **Display Similarity Values**: For specified movies (e.g., \"m1\", \"m10\"), rounded to 7 decimal places.\n",
    "5. **Function `myIBCF`**: Takes a new user's ratings vector, downloads the similarity matrix, and computes predictions for unrated movies. Recommends the top 10 movies based on these predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `myIBCF` Function Details\n",
    "- **Input**: A vector of the new user's ratings for 3,706 movies.\n",
    "- **Prediction Calculation**: Uses the formula involving the similarity matrix and user's ratings.\n",
    "- **Output**: Recommends top 10 movies. If fewer than 10 predictions are non-NA, additional movies not rated by the user are suggested.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup and Configuration\n",
    "- Import libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`.\n",
    "- Configure logging for monitoring and debugging.\n",
    "- Ignore warnings for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Source URLs\n",
    "Constants for file paths or URLs are defined for movies, ratings, users, and rating matrix data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Functions\n",
    "#### `read_data()`\n",
    "- Reads data from URLs using Pandas.\n",
    "- Handles exceptions and logs errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `process_movie_ratings(user_ratings, movies_info)`\n",
    "- Processes movie ratings for averages and counts.\n",
    "- Merges data with movie information.\n",
    "- Handles exceptions and logs errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `explode_movie_genres(movies_with_ratings)`\n",
    "- Expands movie genres into separate rows.\n",
    "- Handles exceptions and logs errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `list_all_genres(genre_ratings)`\n",
    "- Lists all unique genres in the dataset.\n",
    "- Handles exceptions and logs errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `find_top_movies_by_genre(genre_ratings, genre, top_n=10)`\n",
    "- Finds the top N movies in a genre based on weighted ratings.\n",
    "- Handles exceptions and logs errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `sample_random_movies(movies_info, sample_size=10)`\n",
    "- Samples random movies from the dataset.\n",
    "- Handles exceptions and logs errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `calculate_similarity_matrix(ratings_matrix)`\n",
    "- Calculates a cosine similarity matrix from the ratings matrix.\n",
    "- Handles normalization and calculation processes.\n",
    "- Handles exceptions and logs errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `myIBCF(similarity_mat, user_ratings, top_n=10)`\n",
    "- Implements IBCF for movie recommendations.\n",
    "- Handles exceptions and logs errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `test_myIBCF(rating_matrix, similarity_matrix)`\n",
    "- Tests the `myIBCF` function for functionality.\n",
    "- Handles exceptions and logs errors.\n"
